# Welcome to My Ds Babel
This tisk is about converting sql to csv and csv to sql formats. It was useful for getting some knowledge on how one create an sql table.

## Task
The main challenge was to choose a method for converting CSV to sql format. I have chosen pandas dataframe since it converts everything quite accurate. Another challenge was to notice unnecessary \n sign after the header in sql to csv task. 

## Description
It took quite a while for noticing the problem of \n. I read the feedback of gandalf which told me about the number of lines in my code and in that of gandalf check.

## Installation
Open my_ds_babel.py document and delete several # signs to see that the code works, i.e. in front of 1/ #print(sql_to_csv('all_fault_line.db','fault_lines')), 2/ #for row in records: 3/ #print(row), 4/ csv_to_sql(csv_content, 'list_volcano.db','volcanos')  

## Usage
After the arrangement described above just type in the console "python my_ds_babel.py" and one will get results. 

### The Core Team
I did this task by myself. Since noone was doing the task at the time.
